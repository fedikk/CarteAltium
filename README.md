## Learning Altium Designer

During this project, I created a comprehensive guide in PowerPoint format, translating the various steps involved in creating an electronic board with Altium Designer. This guide is designed to assist beginners in understanding fundamental concepts and following a step-by-step process for electronic board design.

The guide is available in the [Guide](Guide/) directory. Feel free to consult it for detailed instructions on using Altium Designer in the context of this project.

Don't forget to download the file [Realisation d'une carte PCB by kouki fedi.pdf](Guide/Realisation%20d'une%20carte%20PCB%20by%20kouki%20fedi.pdf) to access the complete guide.

## Source Files

Source files, including schematics, routing files, and more, are available in the [Main](Main/) directory.
